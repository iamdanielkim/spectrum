  "readme": "Strata is a streaming HTTP framework for node.js that is patterned after\ntime-honored and battle tested web application design principles pioneered in\nthe Python and Ruby communities (see WSGI and Rack). Using Strata, developers\ncan build highly performant web servers in a powerful, modular style that is\neasy to maintain and takes full advantage of the streaming capabilities and\nexcellent I/O handling of node.js.\n\nThe core Strata distribution consists of four things:\n\n  - A specification (see SPEC) for building applications and middleware\n  - A library (see lib) with many useful utilities and middleware to aid\n    developers in the common tasks of building applications that conform to\n    the specification\n  - An executable (see bin/strata) for running Strata applications from the\n    command line\n  - A user manual (see doc) that contains detailed documentation and code\n    examples\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall Strata using [npm](http://npmjs.org/):\n\n    $ npm install strata\n\nYou are also free to [browse or download the source](https://github.com/mjijackson/strata).\n\n## Usage\n\nThe simplest possible Strata app looks like this:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction app(env, callback) {\n    callback(200, {}, \"Hello world!\");\n}\n\nrequire(\"strata\").run(app);\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe [Strata user manual](http://stratajs.org/manual) is designed to teach you\nhow to get up and running with the framework as quickly as possible. Each\nchapter of the manual contains documentation about a certain feature of the\nframework and a code example.\n\nThe manual is written in such a way that the topics and examples discussed in\nhigher numbered chapters build upon previous ones. Thus, it is recommended to\nstart with lower numbered chapters when getting started and work your way up to\nhigher ones.\n\nThe user manual refers to the [SPEC](https://raw.github.com/mjijackson/strata/master/SPEC)\nin various places. This document is the canonical reference for the key building\nblocks of the framework including applications, callbacks, and the Strata\nenvironment.\n\n## Tests\n\nThe test directory contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests for all of\nStrata's core modules. Use [vows](http://vowsjs.org) to run all tests:\n\n    $ vows test/*_test.js\n\nRun the tests for a specific module with:\n\n    $ vows test/utils_test.js\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2011 Michael Jackson\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nThe software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or\nimplied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,\nfitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

It\nborrows many code patterns from these libraries, as well as the [JSGI](http://jackjs.org/jsgi-spec.html)\nproject.\n\nStrata's multipart parser is based on the fast parser in the node-formidable\nproject written by Felix Geisend√∂rfer. It is included in Strata under the terms\nof the MIT license.\n\nMy sincere thanks to the authors of each of these libraries for the excellent\nwork they've done and graciously shared.\n",
